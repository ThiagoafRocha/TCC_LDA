Subsequently, the app needs to configure the IOT device (ESP32) and send Wifi credentials of home network by connecting to ESP's WiFi AP. However, since both the app and IOT device are isolated from each other (except during the configuration process), I don't have much idea on how exactly will mobile app connect (creating a unique IOT thing automatically) and communicate with the isolated IOT device over AWS IOT cloud.</p>\n<p>I have worked with some of the AWS services like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AWS IOT for quite a while, hence I am aware of the basics. One of the possible solutions for the above maybe <strong>Fleet Provisioning by a Trusted User</strong> feature provided by AWS IOT (I did read it's documentation, but still confused). We can also use ESP32's Bluetooth feature for the app to scan nearby devices with which it needs to connect with, but I am not sure how will the connection establish through AWS cloud.</p>\n<p>Since I am a beginner to AWS cloud services, it'd be great if someone can provide a possible solution for the above in detail. Also if possible, please provide a solution which would work incase of a large-scale deployment of the above project.</p>\n"

On the other hand I have many frontend devices (PC, Tablet, Mobile) with GUI application also connected to the broker. So here Mosquitto works as a communication point between backend device and frontend devices and just forwards messages between them. Sometimes amount of data transferred can be quite high (e.g. 1 MB / min).</p>\n\n<p>One backend device + many frontend devices is one installation. I need to prepare infrastructure for thousands of such installations working simultaneously. So my service needs to be very scallable. My company uses Azure cloud solutions, so I've started learning of this solution and I must admit that I am a little bit confused. I've read that I need to use IoT Hub, but it would need MQTT Gateway to be able to speak with MQTT devices. On the other hand, if I understand it well, the Gateway needs to be running on some VM, so here I lose scalability of my solution. Am I right? Now if I will need to support 100k or 500k devices then I will need another VM? One more thing is that I need to integrate all of this with some webservice (for management of backend and frontend devices), so I need some connection between webservice and the MQTT broker...</p>\n\n<p>Before I started to play with Azure, I imagined, that I will simply start an MQTT broker service and magically it will be highly scallable and will be able to provide service for thousands of devices. </p>\n\n<p>Can anybody explain me how to bite that?</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>We are going to use Field Gateways(hardware and software) for connecting 1 or more devices behind the Gateway to Azure IoT Hub. The devices can't connect to Azure IoT Hub themselves. Since only our Gateways will be connected to the Iot Hub we face with problem of Cloud to Sensor communication(we can connect only to the Gateway but not to the each Sensor directly as far as I understand). What is the best practices in this case to provide the Sensor's management through the Gateway from the Iot Hub side? </p>\n\n<p>Of course it depends to what we actually need. In our case we need to support at least direct messages for Sensors (when user interact with Sensor through UI). Also the Sensors firmware update can be required.</p>\n\n<p>One of the possible way is just using Cloud-to-Device messages and put the Sensor data in message body(including sensor id etc). So, the Gateway can receive the message and understand which Sensor should be called. But if the Gateway manages 100  Sensors it can be a problem since the max size of cloud-to-device queue is 50 messages. So this can be a bottleneck if more than 50 Sensors have to be notified at once(we still not have final business requirements). And of course we won't have the responses from the Gateway side(this approach can't be used for long term operation on the Sensors side), however the \"Message feedback\" feature can be enough in our case.</p>\n\n<p>The other possible way is using Desired and Reported properties to store the Sensor specific information in Gateway device twin metadata. So both the Gateway and Cloud can manage the processes on the specific Sensor through device twin of the Gateway.</p>\n\n<p>According to this scenario we should update the necessary information related to the specific Sensor in device twin of Gateway. Then the Gateway can handle this operation, determines the sensor_id and calls required Sensor. To avoid big size of JSON we can storing only the data for \"in-progress\" Sensors. For example if we are working with Sensor1 and Sensor10, both Desired and Reported properties will contain the related information of these Sensors. When the Cloud and\\or Gateway finished communication we can remove the processed item of Sensor from device twin.</p>\n\n<p>This solution looks ugly. Especially when the gateway will have 100  connected sensors for example. </p>\n\n<p>Both these two solutions can be used together depending on our needs. But maybe somebody knows the best way to do it, we haven't enough experience with Azure and IoT.</p>\n\n<p>UPD: Looks like I found the answer. And all other solutions is not our choices \n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54328608/act-for-other-devices-on-azure-iot-hub?rq=1\">Act for other devices on Azure IoT Hub</a></p>\n"

And since it is possible in standard .Net it must be possible in .Net core as well.\nFrom command line I can obtain the information for the connection string by running these commands, so if I must use the sb:// url, can I using c# and the IoT Hub API get this information?</p>\n\n<pre><code>az iot hub show --query properties.eventHubEndpoints.events.endpoint --name HostName\naz iot hub show --query properties.eventHubEndpoints.events.path --name HostName\naz iot hub policy show --name iothubowner --query primaryKey --hub-name HostName\n</code></pre>\n"

        "body": "<p>I have recently started developing UWP projects and have been trying to establish a connection with a <em>'Minew S1'</em> BLE device, which, according to its documentation, has three primary services running.</p>\n\n<p>The documentation does not point out such a way, but I have found a possibility to read the device data (frameType, productModel, batteryLevel, temperature, humidity, MAC address) during the BLE scan, because the device responds (?) to these scans with an undocumented service (UUID: 0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb) and a corresponding serviceData string.</p>\n\n<p>I have created a simple BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher object and subscribed to its Received events. This way I get only one serviceData string from this object during runtime. The code snippet is below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher bleWatcher;\nbleWatcher = new BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher();\nbleWatcher.ScanningMode = BluetoothLEScanningMode.Active;\nbleWatcher.Received += BleWatcher_Received;\nbleWatcher.Stopped += BleWatcher_Stopped;\nbleWatcher.Start();\n\nprivate void BleWatcher_Received(BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher sender, BluetoothLEAdvertisementReceivedEventArgs args)\n    {\n        DataReader dataReader;\n        foreach (var item in args.Advertisement.ServiceUuids)\n        {\n            if (item == new Guid(\"0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb\"))\n            {\n                foreach (var data in args.Advertisement.DataSections)\n                {\n                    dataReader = DataReader.FromBuffer(data.Data);\n\n                    byte[] bytes = new byte[data.Data.Length];\n                    dataReader.ReadBytes(bytes);\n                    if (BitConverter.ToString(bytes).Length &gt; 5)\n                    {\n                        S1Sensor s1 = new 1Sensor(BitConverter.ToString(bytes));\n                        Debug.WriteLine(\"New S1 Sensor advertisement received:\");\n                        Debug.WriteLine(\"Timestamp: \" + DateTime.Now + \", Battery level: \" + s1.BatteryLevel + \"%, Temperature: \" + \n                            s1.Temperature + \"\u00b0C, \" + \"Humidity: \" + s1.Humidity + \"%, MAC Address: \" + s1.MAC_Address + \"==\");\n                    }\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> The above code successfully prints the required data using the S1Sensor helper class method that I wrote. The only problem is that the device's advertising interval, by default, is set to 1000 ms, but I only receive this string once (rarely twice) during application run. Is there a way to receive and process these serviceData more frequently? (preferrably every 1000 ms)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong>\nMy other problem is that this code only returns values when the device is paired to my computer. I think I should be able to scan for devices without connecting and see their response (serviceData) even when the device is not paired to the computer.\nIs there a way to query the serviceData string even when the computer that is running this application not paired to the device?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n"

I know the different commands but want to make it more generic and flexible. So for the basic definition of the commands i created an interface definition.</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IDeviceProtocol\n{\n    // Group a commands\n    void sendAck();\n    void sendNak();\n\n    // Group b commands\n    void someOtherCommand();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By doing so i can use the interface definition and implement the necessary commands per protocol.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class ProtocolV1a: IDeviceProtocol\n{\n    // Explicit interface member implementation: \n    void IDeviceProtocol.sendAck()\n    {\n        SerialWrite(byte 0x0A);\n    }\n\n    // Explicit interface member implementation: \n    void IDeviceProtocol.sendNak()\n    {\n        SerialWrite(byte 0x00);\n    }\n\n    static void Main()\n    {\n       // Some protocol specific code here.\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now i should be able to use the following code in my main program to call the protocol specific class. Is this correct?</p>\n\n<pre><code>IDeviceProtocol Device1 = new ProtocolV1a();\nDevice1.sendAck();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or if it would be a V2 protocol device:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IDeviceProtocol Device2 = new ProtocolV2();\nDevice2.sendAck();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong>\nIs it possible to have some sort of enumerator list with all the possible Protocol versions listed. And based on the returned protocol version from the device create the device class with the correct Protocol class? </p>\n\n<p>Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// returns the protocol used by the device    \n    EnumProtocols pversion = ReceiveProtocol(); \n\n    IDeviceProtocol genericDevice = new IDeviceProtocol(pversion);\n\n    genericDevice.sendAck();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does this approach have a name so i can look that up and learn how to do it?\nCan you give me some pointers where to start looking, or maybe some example code?</p>\n"

It's currently written to support ANT+ sensors though we would like to add (or may possibly replace ANT with) BT/LE support.

We are confident that the process is running in the background as we are using a Linux service that runs on bootup to execute a script. We have verified that the script runs on bootup and successfully pushes data to Dynamo upon user log in (via ssh). We have also tried to disassociate a screen session to allow for the device to publish data to Dynamo but this did not seem to fix the issue. Has anyone else experienced this issue?

If the credentials are NOT correct, how does it let the user know on the smartphone side? At this point, the device's AP doesn't exists and the user would have to jump back on it again.
