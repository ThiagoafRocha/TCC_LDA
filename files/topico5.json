With an OPC UA client I want to read all the data items of the OPC UA servers. </p>\n\n<p>Now I don't know how to build the information model. I design a global information model which contains all machines, their devices and the internal components of the devices. From the global point of view, that makes sense. But do I have to create also a local information model for each server? Or does the local OPC UA server use the global information model, but the server implements only for that server relevant objects (based on the global information model)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is an example setup: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbJDl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbJDl.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the example you can see three layers - machine layer, building layer and factory layer. </p>\n\n<p>Here is my understanding how to model such setups. There is one overall OPC UA information model, which describes all types etc. Each OPC UA server knows that information model and all contained type descriptions. </p>\n\n<p>Now, depending on the real world setup, I can create an object model. An OPC UA server at the machine layer contains all objects from the underlying system, in this example the devices. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5MnC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5MnC.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>With an OPC UA Client at the building layer, I can connect to the OPC UA server from the machines and I can read all data items from the devices inside the machines. </p>\n\n<p>An OPC UA client at the factory layer can connect to the OPC UA servers from the buildings. The OPC UA server at the building level can provide more objects:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NrqgF.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NrqgF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>And an OPC UA client from outside the factory can see the whole picture of the object model: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGy8X.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGy8X.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>But how can I route through the servers to get the device data from outside the factory? Do I have to create the object model from the machine layer again in the building layer? And again in the next higher level layer and so on? </p>\n\n<p>Or does any OPC UA server at each layer know the whole object model like the information model? </p>\n"

Or do I send individual requests from the UI to the server for each device, i.e. start camera 1, start camera 2, start accelerometer, start recording camera1, etc. and handle each success/error state individually?</p>\n<p>My preference throughout the system so far has been the latter approach - one request, one response; with an HTTP error code. However, programming becomes more complex when there are many devices to control, for example - System B has 12 thermocouples.</p>\n<p>Some components of the system are not vital - e.g. if 1 camera fails we can continue, however, if the accelerometer fails the whole system cannot run and so human monitoring is required. If the server started the devices individually from a single 'start' message, should I return an array of errors, or should the server know which components are vital and return a single error if a vital component fails? And in a failure state, should the server then handle stopping each sensor and returning to the original state - and what if that then fails? I foresee this code becoming quite complex with this approach.</p>\n<p>I've been going back and forth over the best way to approach this for months, but I can't find much advice online around building complex, production-ready IoT systems for the real world. If anybody has any advice or could point me towards any papers/books/etc. I would really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Tom</p>\n"

On this access point configuration we also have a TCP Socket Server that intercepts smartphone communications.</p>\n<p>On the smartphone side, we have the part which scans and connects to our device's access point(which works, although i get the esclamation point on the wifi icon since it has no Internet access). After we've connected, we start the Client Socket which connects to the server on our IoT device(the ip address of the server socket is actually the gateway of the access point). And here is where the trouble starts, because the client socket won't start. Here is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>public void SocketInit(String ip, int port) throws IOException {\n    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);\n    SocketAddress sockaddr = new InetSocketAddress(addr, port);\n    nsocket = new Socket();\n    nsocket.setReuseAddress(true);       \n    nsocket.setTcpNoDelay(false);\n    nsocket.setReceiveBufferSize(700);   //Must be less than 730byte witch is the module buffer\n    nsocket.setSendBufferSize(700);\n    nsocket.connect(sockaddr, 5000);     //5 second connection timeout\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here is the exception i get:</p>\n<pre><code>java.net.SocketException: socket failed: ENONET (Machine is not on the network)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I get that error even before reaching nsocket.connect(), precisely on setReuseAddress.</p>\n<p>Since the exception I get is ENONET, I thought that it must be because the access point has no internet access so I used the solution proposed <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37218510/android-6-0-1-force-wifi-connection-with-no-internet-access\">here</a> for testing purpose:</p>\n<pre><code>adb shell settings put global captive_portal_detection_enabled 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a solution that can't be done programmatically without having root access, but I wanted to test if that was the problem. But although the exclamation mark on the wifi icon had disappeared, the client socket still gave me the same exception error.</p>\n<p>Does anybody have a solution for this behaviour?

        "body": "<p>I have a webserver that is running on a network that is not connected to the internet.</p>\n<p>The webserver serves up a website.</p>\n<p>When I connect an android phone to it, I am able to run the website that is on the webserver</p>\n<p>But with certain phones that are running Android 11 I need to disable the mobile data on the phone before it will try to access the website over wifi. It seems the phone will not try to request the url on the wifi network because it doesn't have internet, so it defaults to using the 4G/5G Cellular internet connection. This is too bad, because I would like the phone to use the wifi connection.</p>\n<p>I would think that perhaops I could &quot;force&quot; the phone to use the wifi connection by typing the IP address in the browser's URL bar (eg. <a href=\"http://192.168.211.1/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://192.168.211.1/index.php</a>), however it seems that even with the &quot;local ip&quot; it will still try to use the 4G/5G network instead of the &quot;offline wifi&quot; network.</p>\n<p>The only workaround I have found is to disable moblie data on the phone, but this is not ideal.</p>\n<p>I would think that some IoT devices would have an offline webserver used for configuation/control.</p>\n<p>Is there a certain port or settings I should be using?\nIs there a designated port that the browser/OS would expect to be on an offline network?</p>\n<p>Basically, how can I make the phone use the wifi, even though the wifi is not connected to the internet?</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for any pointers!</p>\n"

It's showing a HTML page (on a mobile phone for example)  that allows to control and interact with a camera module and a A/C relay. With it I can for example show images captured in the camera  I even think it has some image recognition built in, and I can switch on and off a relay for electrical current to a light bulb (110/220v A/C power)</p>\n<p>Before I start pentest I though I better start thinking of what types of exploits one would be able to find and detect? Which sinister exploits I will be able to find, or rather ought be able to find given a proper pentest exercise? (And if I do not find exploits, my approach to the pentest of the Iot might be wrong)</p>\n<p>I ponder it might be a totally pointless exercise since the esp8266 www server (or rather its LUA programming libraries) might not have any security built into it, so basically it is &quot;open doors&quot; and everything with it is unsafe ?</p>\n<p>The test report might just conclude what I can foresee be that the the &quot;user input needs to be sanitized&quot;?</p>\n<p>Anyone have any idea what such pentest of a generic IoT device generally reports?\nMaybe it is possible to crash or reset the IoT device? Buffer overruns, XXS, call own code ?</p>\n<p>I might use ZAP or Burpsuite or similar DAST security test tool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could of course SAST test it instead, or too, but I think it will be hard to find a static code analyzer for the NodeMCU libraries and NUA scripting language easily ? I found some references here though: <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8227299\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8227299</a> but it seems to be a long read.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if someone just have a short answer what to expect in a DAST scan/pentest , it would be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Stay safe and secure out there !\nZombieboy</p>\n"

While I can occasionally get access by tethering a mobile to that network, it isn't often connected, and when it isn't connected, no local device will function on its own, no matter which protocol it uses. Why isn't there any kind of server/cloud resiliency built in where devices can communicate in a peer fashion like Apple's Bonjour (Rendezvous? I can't remember)? If I have an Echo device, I should be able to switch it on through an Alexa interface. I'm OK without speech processing which requires interpretation of commands through an AWS or Google or Apple or whatever cloud, but being able to locally control a switch seems as though the interface could be smart enough to route locally. I guess I may have just answered my question. It seems as though routes could be internally stored so as to not to definitely require a server. Can you imagine shipping a colony to Mars and all the IoT devices stop working? If you ask me, they should not require a branch variation or special programming in order to function.</p>\n"

But as I started testing on newer devices, I discovered this doesn't work as smoothly as before, as now if you connect to a wifi without internet access, you get a message saying \"This network has no internet access. Stay connected?\". The user now has to ideally select \"Dont ask again\" AND select \"Yes\" before the network call is sent to the device.</p>\n\n<p>It kinda sucks UX wise as if the user misses this popup, or dismisses it, the network request won't go through as Android blocks all data transfers until you specifically select \"Yes\" to the popup. If the user misses the popup, they can still see a notification with \"This wifi has no internet access\" to access the popup.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question is : Is there a way to bypass this? Ideally something like a permission that I can ask the user before hand? I haven't found anything so far except for this issue <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42492136/force-android-to-use-wifi-network-with-no-internet\">Force Android to Use Wifi network with no internet</a> that is similar, but in my case the phone doesn't go back to the mobile data, it just doesn't transfer any data between the wifi and the app. Works fine with iOS though :/</p>\n"

However the doc states that disabling networks created by other apps is not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining a connection to an IoT WiFi network with no net access seems to be a reasonable use case for an Android app that Google are (or were) aware of, but I'm struggling to piece together the current best practices for how to do this in 2020. I'm wondering if it's achievable via the newer <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifi-suggest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WiFi suggestion APIs</a>. However these sound like are even more restrictive to app developers and don't offer any guarantees about the WiFi network that will actually be joined.</p>\n"

By listening to port 1883, is there any way that my router is exposed or network vulnerable? This code comes from the <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adafruit MQTT Library Examples</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;\n#include &quot;Adafruit_MQTT.h&quot;\n#include &quot;Adafruit_MQTT_Client.h&quot;\n\n/************************* WiFi Access Point *********************************/\n\nconst char* WLAN_SSID = &quot;SSID&quot;;\nconst char* WLAN_PASS = &quot;password&quot;;\n\n/************************* Adafruit.io Setup *********************************/\n\n#define AIO_SERVER      &quot;mqtt.gbridge.io&quot;\n#define AIO_SERVERPORT  1883                   // use 8883 for SSL\n#define AIO_USERNAME    &quot;gbridge-username&quot;\n#define AIO_KEY         &quot;mqqt password&quot;\n\n/************ Global State (you don't need to change this!) ******************/\n\n// Create an ESP8266 WiFiClient class to connect to the MQTT server.\nWiFiClient client;\n// or... use WiFiFlientSecure for SSL\n//WiFiClientSecure client;\n\n// Setup the MQTT client class by passing in the WiFi client and MQTT server and login details.\nAdafruit_MQTT_Client mqtt(&amp;client, AIO_SERVER, AIO_SERVERPORT, AIO_USERNAME, AIO_KEY);\n\n/****************************** Feeds ***************************************/\n\n// Setup a feed called 'photocell' for publishing.\n// Notice MQTT paths for AIO follow the form: &lt;username&gt;/feeds/&lt;feedname&gt;\nAdafruit_MQTT_Publish onoffset = Adafruit_MQTT_Publish(&amp;mqtt,&quot;on off set link&quot;);\n\n// Setup a feed called 'onoff' for subscribing to changes.\nAdafruit_MQTT_Subscribe onoffbutton = Adafruit_MQTT_Subscribe(&amp;mqtt,&quot;on off link&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Update August 2020:\ngbridge has shutdown their servers</p>\n"

It has a slew of REST API's that can be accessed to perform various tasks.  I have a couple of these setup with static IP addresses and all works great.  My problem is scale.  The potential exists to have hundreds(to thousands) of these running and need to be controlled by a single mobile app.  I don't want to have thousands of static IP's.  Though this would be the easiest solution it certainly wouldn't be cost effective and most likely a nightmare to manage.</p>\n<p>My desire is to &quot;connect&quot; all of these Raspberry Pi webservers to the Azure IoT hub.  The webservers do not need to talk to each other, but the mobile app needs to be able to send REST messages to each server individually.</p>\n<p>The coding of the app, the coding on the Pi's and any additional coding is not an issue.  I've been an applications developer for over 20 years so coding is not an issue.</p>\n<p>So, my questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the minimum necessary to be running on the Pi to connect to the Azure IoT Hub?</li>\n<li>Do I understand correctly that to do what I've described above, I have to send a message to the Hub and then the Hub sends a message to the device?</li>\n<li>Does anything exist to define the Pi as an endpoint and just be able to send the REST messages directly to that?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any help provided, even links to relevant documents, would be greatly appreciated.

services:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Private Retrofit: bound on the network object I receive from the wifi callback, expose api to communicate with my vehicle within the local network.</li>\n<li>Public Retrofit: bound on the network object I received from the mobile data callback, expose api to communicate with my backend and everything else that needs the internet.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At this point in my app I am able to redirect the traffic that passes through retrofit, \nbut how do the libraries that I include in the project understand which network they should use?\nAnswer: they don't understand it, in fact they try to use the wifi network getting a timeout error.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed this behavior when I added google maps to my application, the canvas showed only an empty grid. \nSince it is not possible to redirect google maps traffic through the public retrofit service that I created earlier i had to look for another solution to fix this.</p>\n\n<p>Here it is ConnectivityManager.bindProcessToNetwork() that you have seen before!\n<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#bindProcessToNetwork(android.net.Network)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#bindProcessToNetwork(android.net.Network)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With this method I am able to tell the process of my application that all the sockets created in the future must use the network that came from the callback of mobile data.</p>\n\n<p>Using this trick, google maps and all the other libraries of which I cannot control connectivity, they will use the data connection to communicate with the internet and therefore they will work properly.</p>\n\n<p>In some phones, especially the older versions of android, there is still the problem of other applications that remain without connectivity because they try to use wifi instead of using mobile data.\nAs a user I would be quite frustrated if using one app all the others won't work anymore.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So I would like to understand if there is a way to meet all my requirements in such a way that both my app and the others work without problems regardless of the Android version and the phone vendor.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, my questions are:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why \"Network without internet access\" popup does not appear if connection is made programmatically?</li>\n<li>If Android known that my WiFi has no internet access, why others applications don't use mobile data network as fallback automatically?</li>\n<li>Is possible to tell android that other applications must use a certain network to open future sockets?</li>\n<li>Each vendor has custom WiFi settings to provide enhanced internet experience (<a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/it/support/content/it-it00746335/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Huawei WiFi+</a>, <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/galaxy-note-8-what-is-adaptive-wifi/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Samsung Adaptive WiFi</a>, <a href=\"https://oppo-au.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4992/~/wi-fi-assistant\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oppo WiFi Assistant</a>, ...). I have noticed that in some phones activating it solve other applications problem, it seems that these features have permissions to rebind the entire application ecosystem on a specific network interface. How can these features help / hinder me? Is it possible to write some code that does the same thing these features do?</li>\n</ol>\n"

        "body": "<p>I'm looking for a way to managing and controlling IoT devices without the (constant) need for a remote server to be part in it and with a PWA instead of a native application on the managing device. The resulting goal is an IoT device that keeps working when a product eventually goes obsolete (no more server running/allocated) and having an application that has PWA benefits like always up-to-date, easy to replicated and cheaply hosted on something like S3.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, let's say I have one or more IoT devices of different classes like an ESP8266 and a Raspberry Pi for instance. Just as with any new IoT device I want to add it to the network and from there on manage its state from an app. The app in this case is a PWA instead of full blown native app.</p>\n\n<p>1) Traditionally, in the initial setup a native app would scan for wifi networks, connecting automatically to one that has the right name. Using PWA's we are limited to just the \"<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">state</a>\" of the network. So users would have to manually switch to the network of the newly connected IoT device. This is okay.</p>\n\n<p>2) Next up, the user would need to enter his/her wifi credentials. There might be methods to set this up automatically using a native app, but I don't believe this is the case on a PWA. This, also, is okay.</p>\n\n<p>3) The device then restarts, tries to connect to the network set up in (2). If set up correctly it should get its IP using DHCP. And now things get difficult. I want to 'discover' that network from my PWA. There used to be a way to retrieve the IP from a device using the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20194722/can-you-get-a-users-local-lan-ip-address-via-javascript\">WebRTC API</a>. but that since has changed to show an <a href=\"http://net.ipcalf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">obfuscated mdns</a> that resolves to localhost. The ip leak would have allowed for a browser based network scan, but that is no longer possible. I always hoped that Android would default to using a users router as a DNS server, but that is not the case. The result is that simply using an mDNS isn't an option either. I do not want user having to check their router, install an app like fing or do anything else that disrupts the flow from a UX perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Step (3) needs to run every time the app starts so you'd want something reliable. <strong>Scanning for devices isn't possible using a PWA, so I need to find another method.</strong> I was thinking of something like the way Docker containers can find each other in between networks (see etcd for example), using a predefined key that is shared during installation. The problem with this, is that it requires a remote server to store the IPs attached to that key. I don't want that.</p>\n\n<p>Ideas on how to solve this are very much appreciated! I want to be able to offer a solution that would work even when WAN is out. That being said, I am aware that a connection to a remote server is needed if the end user would want to enable any voice assistant or wants to control a device from WAN.</p>\n"

Just for fun, I've been playing around with the original firmware and wondering how this coupling process is solved. The Gosund sockets are based on the ESP8266 and have no Bluetooth on the hardware side, only W-LAN. The Android app starts a search process when pairing, finds the socket, sends the settings and the setup is finished. But how exactly is this solved on the software side?</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in that, because I want to reproduce the same way it is solved for our app.\nMy first theory was that the Gosunds, similar to Tasmota, open an access point with a webserver behind it and the app sends the settings via REST calls. </p>\n\n<p>For testing purposes I implemented this in a small prototype, which also works so far. But you can see with my code that the phone is changing the wifi. Open connections are closed and so on... With the Gosund app this is not the case. My mobile phone stays in my W-LAN the whole time but manages to send the settings via Wifi to the gosund plug <strong>at the same time</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>How is that solved?</p>\n\n<p>Alternative theory: The app opens an access point and the gosund plug tries to connect. But can Android do that? Stay logged in to a wifi and open a hotspot at the same time?</p>\n"

I've task connecting (REST) to my IOT-device through Internet. For that I want use DO droplet with real IP(for sample 178.62.209.11) and setup OpenVPN on it. For my home LAN I've buy the Mikrotik Router RB951Ui-2HnD which must allow setup the OpenVPN client. So, my LAN with DO Droplet must be VPN. </p>\n\n<p>And now my question is how to do traffic translation from MY SERVER 178.62.209.11 to LOCAL device IOT 192.168.1.11? I understand that my server have only one IP, but I look that may be port forwording! For sample, if I want send request to my IOT device by 80 port, then I can use for that port forwards, like 178.62.209.11:1234 &lt;=> 192.168.1.11:80, and for second IOT device 178.62.209.11:1235 &lt;=> 192.168.1.15:80, and etc.</p>\n\n<p>I found how to set OpenVPN to DO Droplet, I found how adjust OpenVPN client on the router, but can not found how get simple access to my device. Can you help?</p>\n"

Code of admin.php is loaded correctly, but only html tags. PHP is commented automatically by the browser. Also vue library is ignored, but I didnt went there yet. </p>\n\n<p>The question is: \n- how to use php generated by apache files in google chrome packaged apps\nif it is not possible:\n- is that possible to create tcp server within google packaged app, and let it communicate with normal page? </p>\n"

        "body": "<p>What is the proper way to connect an app to a device? At the moment, I have a raspberry pi 3 that controls something about electricity and an iPhone app I created. Every time the app goes to foreground, it sends a UDP broadcast message, when the app receives a response from the raspberry pi, it uses that IP address (in the IP header) to consume the web services I created in the hub. This UDP process is done all the time you run the app. Is this what IOT devices usually do? I assume the raspberry pi IP will change sooner or later.</p>\n\n<p>A colleague of mine told me another way: After the first time I get the IP address, instead of using UDP broadcast messages every time the app runs, use ICMP to ping the previously saved IP address to see if it is responding. In that case, I use the web services with that IP address, otherwise, use the UPD broadcast message again.</p>\n\n<p>I don't see the point of that. Basically because the system is not faster using ICMP. (a UDP request is more or less as fast as an ICMP request). Moreover, maybe, another device started using that IP address now (like a smart TV or a smart plug) and for that reason, it is not going to reply to the network requests sent by the app. In that case, the app cannot recover, because it thinks it is already connected to the proper device. As far as I understand, ICMP is a protocol use for diagnosis, not for devices discovery.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? What's the process used by devices like Alexa, Philips Hue, Smart plugs... to solve the problem of discovering the devices by their apps?\nIt seems Philips HUE is using SSDP, which under the hood uses a UDP broadcast message. Is it used every time you run the app to discover the IP address? (I am going to check this later with wireshark)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for suggestions.</p>\n"

Since COAP uses an addressing scheme similar to web, any client having the address of this server shall be able to talk to this COAP server (i.e. peripheral) and control its attributes. </p>\n\n<p>I have certain doubts about how a client not present in the same LAN as the server, can discover this server and the resources exposed by it. I understand that COAP facilitates resource discovery using CoRE link format but it seems that it primarily uses multicast which can only work within a LAN. I don't want to put a resource directory server at home and various COAP servers registering with it and then this directory server talking to a server sitting in the cloud. I want to have the ability to just install a peripheral at the home which can communicate to a remote client (like COPPER) using wifi home network. But how to discover the COAP server sitting at home from a remote location and then talk to it considering that COAP server will be on a private IP address. \nIs this really possible using just COAP?</p>\n"

Connecting the logger to the device, we can see that it believes that it is sending out messages correctly, and that it is paired with the phone.  The solution appears to be forgetting the BLE pairing from the Bluetooth settings on the phone, and sometimes restarting the phone as well.

I know that ISP's change public IP addresses regularly (dynamic IP address). I know that to get around this, one could use a service like \"no-ip\", etc. Or one could get a static IP address.</p>\n\n<p>What I do not understand is how some of the latest home automation devices are able to be controlled remotely without use of a static IP, or a service like \"no-ip\". For example, a wifi enabled thermostat, or lighting system.</p>\n\n<p>If the device had a built in server, or client, then I assume that the device could connect to an outside server in a remote location. The user could then also log into that server and send commands to the device. What I don't understand is how commands sent to the device from a cell phone, for example, can reach the home device. Presumably the off site location of the server would have to know the public IP address where the devise is located, and then port-forwarding would have to be set up to allow access to the device.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing here?

        "body": "<p>I have a internet connected IoT device (let's say advanced internet connected weather sensor, which can send sensor data and perform some advanced operations like rotating, switching on, opening valves/and few other operations). </p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT:</em></p>\n\n<p>The device is wall powered (electricity socket), and has <strike>mobile internet connection</strike> standard wired Ethernet connection (just plug in Cat5 cable)</p>\n\n<p>I need to be able to get status (approx 500bytes of data) of the device, AND want to be able to <strong>send <em>simple commands</em> like</strong>: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>rotate-180-deg</code></li>\n<li><code>turn-lights-on</code></li>\n<li><code>turn-lights-off</code></li>\n<li><code>open-valve-1</code> </li>\n<li><code>switch-sensor-X-on</code></li>\n<li><code>switch-sensor-X-off</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Currently my device is sending a HTTP request every (2minutes) to my central server with it's status. This works perfectly for getting readings of the devices sensors. However this approach becomes more problematic when I want to send commands to the devices. Eg. if I want to send command <code>rotate-180-degrees</code>, my central server has to wait until it is contacted by the device and in the Response for the HTTP request - I can put some command, so when the device receives the response, it will actually execute the command.</p>\n\n<p>However this approach has flaws: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it is not real time (I have to wait for 2-3 minutes before I have a chance to send a command)</li>\n<li>i do not know whether the command was received by the device or not (eg. in case of network error)</li>\n<li>i do not know whether the device has acknowledged or executed the command (neither the status)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What could be the solutions for this problem?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:\nAs @mhopeng suggested, the most flexible solution seems to be turning the device into a \"server\", so that it can accept incoming connections. However, because the considerations of security, firewalls and complexity we cannot go this way. Also device needs to be simple to install: third party maintenance stuff should be able to simply plug the device into wall and ethernet, and it should work. (No need for configuring port forwarding, firewalls, etc).</p>\n\n<p>FYI We also use PIC microcontrollers in this device. </p>\n"

My requirement is to use WebREPL via the University Wi-Fi, which uses WPA2 Enterprise EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication.

What I've tried so far is to attempt a hotspot using Connectify but there's been no luck there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I appreciate any help you guys can provide.

In this place there is no WIFI access nor power outlets, so it will run on batteries. I hope the computing in this component to be as low as possible, so if it can be done without it running on linux or other OS it would be great.</p></li>\n<li><p>The second component will communicate with the first one and with my router so I can access it remotely via Internet. This one can be plugged to a power outlet.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The usage of this would consist on me being able to log on my phone (with an app I create) to the second component for it to show me the live video and send a signal through it to open the food container door for a set amount of time. I have one BeagleBone Black I can use for this project, which I think I will apply on the second component.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> What protocol would be suitable for the communication between both components (bluetooth, zigbee, 6lowpan, etc)? The camera will probably be 640*480 or higher and there is no problem on delays (~ 15s - 20s) as long as I can watch relatively continuous live video to check my dog is eating and well. It should be as low-power consuming as possible for batteries to run a long time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Is there any way to make the first component be able to stream the video without it running an OS?</p>\n\n<p>I know there are some more logical solutions (extend the wifi network, buy an already on market solution, etc) but I am wishing to use this project as a learning instance for IoT as well. I have done research, but have not been able to land on any convincing conclusions. I hope you guys can help me on this or at least point me on the right direction.

The adapter itself is made by Belkin.  Using this, I can see an ip of 169.stuff get generated for my Pi, which is a private ip.

Also, if SIM is replaced, I want the device to automatically know the PIN for the new SIM. So I was thinking of using a one way hash function to generate the pin from one or more properties of the SIM like its IMSI, ICCID, SIM Card Group Identifier, Service Provider Name etc.</p>\n\n<p>When a SIM is inserted, the device can dynamically calculate the correct PIN based on these properties.</p>\n\n<p>(I know that security based on secret algorithm violates the basic principles of computer security, but in this case I don't need it to be fool proof - I just need something better than leaving it unprotected.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that none of these properties can be read before entering the PIN.\nIs there any other property that can be read without entering the PIN? Or do you have any work around that does not require storing of PIN on the device in advance?</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>I've recently bought an Arduino ethernet shield but couldn't get it work. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried to use the example's code but it did not work. I have even tried to get a static IP without DHCP and it's always the same problem . </p>\n\n<p>I've used this code : </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Ethernet.h&gt;\n\n// Enter a MAC address for your controller below.\n// Newer Ethernet shields have a MAC address printed on a sticker on the shield\nbyte mac[] = { 0x90, 0xA2, 0xDA, 0x0F, 0xE1, 0xBF };\n// if you don't want to use DNS (and reduce your sketch size)\n// use the numeric IP instead of the name for the server:\n//IPAddress server(74,125,232,128);  // numeric IP for Google (no DNS)\nchar server[] = \"www.google.com\";    // name address for Google (using DNS)\n\n// Set the static IP address to use if the DHCP fails to assign\nIPAddress ip(192,168,1,10);\n\n// Initialize the Ethernet client library\n// with the IP address and port of the server \n// that you want to connect to (port 80 is default for HTTP):\nEthernetClient client;\n\nvoid setup() {\n // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n   while (!Serial) {\n    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for Leonardo only\n  }\n\n  // start the Ethernet connection:\n  if (Ethernet.begin(mac) == 0) {\n    Serial.println(\"Failed to configure Ethernet using DHCP\");\n    // no point in carrying on, so do nothing forevermore:\n    // try to congifure using IP address instead of DHCP:\n    Ethernet.begin(mac, ip);\n  }\n  // give the Ethernet shield a second to initialize:\n  delay(1000);\n  Serial.println(\"connecting...\");\n\n  // if you get a connection, report back via serial:\n  if (client.connect(server, 80)) {\n    Serial.println(\"connected\");\n    // Make a HTTP request:\n    client.println(\"GET /search?q=arduino HTTP/1.1\");\n    client.println(\"Host: www.google.com\");\n    client.println(\"Connection: close\");\n    client.println();\n  } \n  else {\n    // kf you didn't get a connection to the server:\n    Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n  // if there are incoming bytes available \n  // from the server, read them and print them:\n  if (client.available()) {\n    char c = client.read();\n    Serial.print(c);\n  }\n\n  // if the server's disconnected, stop the client:\n  if (!client.connected()) {\n    Serial.println();\n    Serial.println(\"disconnecting.\");\n    client.stop();\n\n    // do nothing forevermore:\n    while(true);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I got this answer: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Failed to configure Ethernet using DHCP\nconnecting...\nconnected\n\ndisconnecting.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I be sure that my ethernet shield is working correctly and how can I resolve this problem? </p>\n"

        "body": "<p>Among other devices, I have a Belkin WeMo switch and a 3M WiFi Thermostat. Both come with Android apps. When I open the app when at home (phone on the same WiFi subnet as the devices) the app says the devices are \"local\", or that the app is connected \"directly\" to the device. Any change I make is then directly reflected on the device.</p>\n\n<p>If I connect from anywhere outside my house, it some how \"knows\" that the device is not local. If I understand correctly, it then updates its own server somewhere, and eventually the device at home gets the update.</p>\n\n<p>How does an app do that? I want to replicate that functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I have a Raspberry Pi that, let's say does something over GPIO and I can trigger that action by visiting a web page. On my home network, the web page is accessible at <code>http://192.168.10.25/do_something</code> ...Outside my home network, the web page is accessible at <code>http://my_custom_name.some_free_dynamic_dns.com:8080/do_something</code>. I have set up my router to port forward 8080 on WAN to 192.168.10.25:80 on LAN. This works.</p>\n\n<p>How do I avoid having 2 pages? I want to write an app which effectively shows me the <code>192.168.10.25/do_something URL</code>. When I am at home, it should \"automatically\" detect that the phone is on the same network as the URL, and just open <code>192.168.10.25/do_something</code> directly ... and when I am outside, it should \"automatically\" detect that too and launch <code>http://my_custom_name.some_Free_dynamaic_dns.com:8080/do_something</code>. </p>\n\n<p>The key part here is that when at home, even if my ISP is down and host names aren't resolving, it shouldn't matter because everything is local.</p>\n\n<p>How do I go about doing this?</p>\n"

My only hesitation about using websockets is because I need to update an array on the webserver fairly often and this seems like a PUT rest operation.  Thanks</p>\n"
